# AI Code Reviewer – Milestone 1 (Infosys Springboard)

This repository contains the first milestone of the **AI Code Reviewer** project developed as part of the *Infosys Springboard* learning program.

 Project Overview

The goal of this milestone is to build a **Python AST-based code parser** that analyzes Python code and detects syntax errors.
It uses Python’s built-in `ast` module to parse code safely and return structured results.

⚙️ Features

* Parses Python code using Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
* Detects syntax errors
* Returns structured output with success status
* Clean and modular Python implementation

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)

📂 Project Structure

* `code_parser.py` – Core parser logic
* `requirements.txt` – Project dependencies
* `.gitignore` – Excludes sensitive files like `.env`

🔒 Security Note

API keys and environment variables are stored in a `.env` file which is intentionally excluded from this repository for security reasons.

🎯 Milestone Objective

To implement a basic static code parser as the foundation for future AI-powered code analysis and suggestions.
